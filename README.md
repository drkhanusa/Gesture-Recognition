# Gesture-Recognition
Real-Time Continuous Gesture Recognition with Wireless Wearable IMU Sensors

The general overview of the proposed action recognition framework is shown as follows. It can be regarded as two stages. First, we project each channel signal as a square matrix using modified RP respectively and combine them into a color image. After normalization, we implement a tiny ResNet to do the classification task end to end.
