# Gesture-Recognition
Real-Time Continuous Gesture Recognition with Wireless Wearable IMU Sensors

The general overview of the proposed action recognition framework is shown as follows. It can be regarded as two stages. First, i project each channel signal as a square matrix using modified RP(recurence plot) respectively and combine them into a color image. After normalization, we implement a tiny ResNet to do the classification task end to end.
